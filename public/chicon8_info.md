# Information

Welcome to the 80th World Science Fiction Convention - Chicon 8! We’re excited to participate in the con both in-person in the hotel and online around the world! Here’s what you need to know to navigate our hybrid space.

If you are only attending Chicon 8 virtually, filter using the "Virtual" tag to see what program items will be accessible to you.

Virtual items will NOT??? be recorded. Just like at an in-person convention, you’ll have to choose what to participate in each hour.

All times listed are in CST unless otherwise noted.
