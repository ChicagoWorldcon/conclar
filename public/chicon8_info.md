# Information

Welcome to the 80th World Science Fiction Convention - Chicon 8! We’re excited to participate in the con both in-person in the hotel and online around the world! If you are only attending Chicon 8 virtually, filter using the "Virtual" or "Hybrid" tag to see what program items will be accessible to you. "Hybrid" indicates those panels and participants that are available both in person and virtually!

Please note that panels you check for the "My Schedule" option are not sharable amoungst different devices. So, your phone and your tablet will display different lists.

All times listed below are in CDT unless otherwise noted.

Note: We're sorry the schedule is going to be slow to load right now. We are working on these issues and hope to have them fixed before the con.
