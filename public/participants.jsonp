Schoen holds a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology, is a past Astounding, Hugo, &amp; Nebula, nominee, twice won the C&oacute;yotl award for best novel, founded the Klingon Language Institute, and occasionally does work as a hypnotherapist specializing in authors&rsquo; issues. He is also a cancer survivor. His science fiction includes many light and humorous adventures of a space-faring stage hypnotist and his alien animal companion. Other works take a very different tone, exploring aspects of determinism and free will, generally redefining the continua between life and death. Sometimes he blurs the funny and the serious.

As a biochemist, I can tell you that terraforming is a much more difficult and time consuming project than most people realise. I don&#39;t have ships that fly at the &#39;speed of plot&#39;, but find it more interesting to see what kind of plots and stories would be supported when the space ships move at realistic pace.",

"bio": "The Shake Ups are an award-winning, Midwestern-based power-pop band that blends co-ed vocals, bouncy melodies and infectious energy into a refreshingly charming sound. Originally formed in 2005, The Shake Ups write and perform songs based on their favorite cartoons, science fiction, con life and pop culture. Live performances include a multimedia presentation and a healthy assortment of classic cartoon themes alongside their original creations. Music releases of The Shake Ups have been acclaimed not only by fans of the respective cartoon series, but also parents, teachers, and even musicians and voice talent from the series themselves. The Shake Ups have appeared across the U.S. at conventions such as GenCon, Wizard World, Comic Con, Pop Con and Youmacon, among others. Nuvo Newsweekly&#39;s annual reader&#39;s poll awarded The Shake Ups the title of Best Pop Band for three consecutive years. The band&#39;s latest album is a Saturday morning cartoon-fueled extravaganza. The Shake Ups continue to build on their reputation as a primary force in the independent music community, bringing joy to children of all ages, as well as pop culture enthusiasts and the indie music echelon. The Shake Ups are professional crowd pleasers... and the galaxy&#39;s most animated band!",
