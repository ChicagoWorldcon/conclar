Raven's love of tartan in particular has lead to several publications in local vintage fashion magazines and national sites like Jezebel on the role of plaid in 19th century American women's clothing. When not traveling through time and space, you can usually find her trying not to die in Pandemic Legacy or yelling about balls (the dancing kind) on TikTok.",
