# ConClár

ConClár is an online Program Guide tool for conventions.

It has been developed in ReactJS and is intended to work in all modern browsers. It is designed to work equally well on mobile and desktop devices.

No application needs to be downloaded and installed as it works in a browser.

The main page is the Program/Programme page. This page shows all of the scheduled sessions that will take place during the conventions.
